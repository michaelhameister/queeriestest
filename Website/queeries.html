				<br> Most schools across the country do not offer adequete sex education for LGBTQ students. This is surprising since people of this community can encounter unique and horrific problems that normal straight children would not encounter. With the high suicide rate and increaded mental health problems that queer students are dealing with they need and easy, inclusive, and informative way to get this information. Queeries was made to answer the questions that young queer people have in an easy to understand format.</p>
			<p id="right">Fewer than five percent of LGBT students had health classes that included positive representations of LGBT-related topics

Research has shown that queer people are more likely to have begun having sex at an early age and to have multiple partners compared to their heterosexual peers, more likely to have sex while under the influence of alcohol or other drugs, more likely to experience dating violence, less likely to use condoms or birth control when they have sex, more likely to contract HIV or other STIs, more likely to experience teen pregnancy

research also showed that LGBTQ youth have a limited number of trusted adults they feel comfortable talking with about sexual health, so they frequently seek information online or from peers. Much of the sexual health information online is neither age-appropriate nor medically accurate, and peers may be misinformed.</p>
